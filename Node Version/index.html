      <h1> Why are refineries bad? </h1>
      <p> This is a misleading question. Refineries are not inherently bad. However, they can be bad when they are located near communities. </p>
      <p> This is definitely the case in Detroit. There are over X refineries in the city and all are located near communities. </p>
      <p> To find where the refineries are loacted, visit the our <a href="map.html" > Refinery Map! </a> </p>
